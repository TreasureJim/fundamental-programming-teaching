# Teaching Fundamental Programming

This repository has been set up so all teacher assistants for the fundamental programming course can add content together making it easily accessible to students. 

This site is built using the (Astro)[https://astro.build/] framework. This framwork allows you to write both in HTML (.astro) and markdown (.md). 

You can add your own lesson(s) by creating a file under the [/src/pages/lesson](/src/pages/lesson) folder. Create a pull request and maintainers of the package will merge it into the repo.
